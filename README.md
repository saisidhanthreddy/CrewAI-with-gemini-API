# CrewAI with Gemini - AI in Healthcare Research and Writing

This repository contains a Python project using CrewAI integrated with Google’s Gemini model to research and write about groundbreaking technologies in AI for healthcare. It leverages the `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` model via Google AI Studio’s API key, along with the `SerperDevTool` for internet search capabilities.

The project features two agents:
1. **Senior Researcher**: Identifies the next big trend in AI in healthcare, focusing on pros, cons, market opportunities, and risks.
2. **Writer**: Crafts a compelling, easy-to-understand article based on the research findings.

## Project Structure
- `agents.py`: Defines the Senior Researcher and Writer agents with their goals and backstories.
- `tools.py`: Configures the internet search tool using a Serper API key.
- `tasks.py`: Specifies tasks for research and writing outputs.
- `crew.py`: Orchestrates the CrewAI process with the agents and tasks.
- `.env`: Stores environment variables (API keys).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A virtual environment (e.g., `venv`)
- API keys:
  - Google AI Studio API Key for Gemini model access
  - Serper API Key for internet search functionality

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository from GitHub and navigate into the project directory.

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
Create a new virtual environment and activate it to isolate dependencies.

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages: `crewai`, `crewai-tools`, `litellm`, and `python-dotenv`.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Google AI Studio and Serper API keys in the following format:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-ai-studio-api-key`
- `SERPER_API_KEY=your-serper-api-key`

Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys.

### 5. Verify Your Setup
Ensure all project files (`agents.py`, `tools.py`, `tasks.py`, `crew.py`) are present and configured to use the Gemini model and Serper tool with the environment variables.

## Usage
Run the main script to research and write about AI in healthcare:
- Execute the script from the command line after activating the virtual environment.
- **Output**: 
  - A 3-paragraph report from the research task (printed to the console).
  - A 4-paragraph markdown article saved as `new-blog-post.md`.

## Troubleshooting
- **Import Errors**: Verify all required packages are installed. Reinstall them if necessary.
- **API Key Issues**: Test your Gemini API key independently to ensure it’s valid. Regenerate it from Google AI Studio if it fails.
- **Model Errors**: If the model doesn’t work, try alternative Gemini model names like `gemini-1.5-flash` or ensure your API key has proper permissions.
